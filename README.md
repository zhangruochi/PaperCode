## The paper I have published

- This repo contains some experimental materials for the research project
- I have published some papers based on these experiments
- My research area is mainly about data mining algorithms for the biomedical big data. Specifically, I am interested in developing efficient feature selection and prediction algorithms for the high-dimensional biomedical data.
